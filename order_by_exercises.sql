# Modify your fist query to order by first name.  The first result should be Irena Pelz and the last results should be Vidya Awdeh

# Update the query to order by first name and then last name.  The first result should now be Irena Acton and the last should be Vidya Zweizig

# Change the ORDER BY clause so that you order by last name before first name.  Your first result should still be Irena Acton but now the last result should be Maya Zyda.

# Update your queries for employees with 'e' in their last name to sort the results by their employee number.  Make sure the employee numbers are in the correct order

# Now reverse the sort order for both queries and compare the results.
