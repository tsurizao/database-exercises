# MySQL provides a way to return only unique results from our queries with the keyword DISTINCT.  For example to find all the unique titles within a company, we could run the following query:
#SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles;

# List the first 10 distinct last name sorted in descending order.

# Create a query to get the top 5 salaries and display just the employees number from the salaries table.

# Try to think of your results as batches, sets or pages.  The first five results are your first page.  The five after that would be your second page, etc.  Update the previous query to find the tenth page of results
